# Fraud Detection in Mobile Money Transactions

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning.  
The system classifies transactions as *fraudulent (1)* or *legitimate (0)*.

### Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering (e.g., time & amount patterns)
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Exporting the trained model for deployment

### To Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/model.py
